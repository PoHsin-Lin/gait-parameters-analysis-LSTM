# gait-parameters-analysis-LSTM

This repository contains the walking data collected from six volunteers, a step event detector, and stride length estimators.

The walking data is collected from leg-and-shoe-mounted [EcoIMU](https://epl.tw/ecomini/). Five EcoIMU are attached to human body, as shown in

![Collecting the walking data with EcoIMU through BLE](pics/system_overview.pdf)

Step event detection and stride length estimation based on leg-and-shoe-mounted EcoIMU and LSTM.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
